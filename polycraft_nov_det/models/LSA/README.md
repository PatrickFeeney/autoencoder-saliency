# Latent Space Autoregression for Novelty Detection

This folder contains models based on the encoder and decoder architectures from ["Latent Space Autoregression for Novelty Detection"](https://github.com/aimagelab/novelty-detection). Note that current models do not utilize the estimator aspects of the paper.

The "unmodified" folder contains code taken directly from the LSA repository. Changes should not be made in that folder and should instead take the form of new Python files within this folder.
